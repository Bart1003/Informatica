	<p><strong>Gather up all of the papers you've decided you don't need and make piles of up to 3 sheets of paper each.</strong> If you want you can rip them one by one if you are bored.</p>
	<h2><strong>2.</strong>		<img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Conquer-Your-Paper-Piles-Step-3.jpg/aid100349-v4-728px-Conquer-Your-Paper-Piles-Step-3.jpg.webp" width="240" height="180"></h2>
	<p><strong>Put two hands directly in the middle of the sheets, with both thumbs on the side facing you and fingers on the outside.</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Recycle all of the papers.</strong> If they are important papers, you may want to shred up the papers first in a paper shredder.</p>
		
	

	<h2 id="Tips"><strong>Tips</strong></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not try to rip or "break by bending" a credit card. Always safely shred or cut into tiny sections and throw away in a secure place.</li>
		<li>Get a paper shredder for quicker and easier disposal of papers.</li>
		<li>If you have difficultly ripping a pile of papers, divide them into even smaller piles and try again.</li>
		<li>If possible, when disposing of credit card, use a magnet on the card to erase/damage it's memorized data. This way, even if someone manages to put it in one piece, it won't be of much use for them.</li>
		<li>If they are important papers like credit card reports or checks, then you may want to rip them up into even smaller sections. A good size would be less than a quarter inch by a quarter inch.</li>
		<li>Rip papers into very small pieces to decrease the likelihood of someone piecing them back together.</li>
		<li>For additional security, throw away part of the document or credit card one week, and then the other part the next week - this makes it that much more difficult for someone to piece them back together. An alternative is to throw away part at home, and part at school, work, or a trash can in a public place, like a restaurant or other business.</li>
		<li>Be very careful about paper cuts!</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2 id="Warnings"><strong>Warnings</strong></h2>
	<ul>
		<li>If you are ripping paper because you are bored make sure it is rubbish.</li>
		<li>Do not tear up old bills, medical information, or papers that have your credit card numbers or personal information on them. Always shred or safely dispose of.</li>
		<li>Do not rip legal documents. Shred them instead for ensured safety of the documents.</li>
	</ul>
