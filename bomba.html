    <h2>Part 1: Preparing Your Pond.</h2>
	<h3><strong>1. Check the dimensions of your pond.</strong></h3>
	<p>In order to stock your garden pond with fish, you will need to make sure the pond is large enough to support the fish you intend to introduce. Fish need a certain amount of space, as well as variation in depth.<sup><a href="#[1]">[1]</a></sup></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your pond should have a minimum 12-15 square feet of surface area in order to add fish.</li>
		<li>The pond will need one area that is greater than two feet deep for hibernating amphibians if you intend to have any frogs.</li>
		<li>The pond will also need a number of areas that are under one foot in depth to support different species of aquatic plant life.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><strong>2.	Ensure the pond liner is appropiate and intact.</strong></h3>
	<p>If your garden pond is manmade, it likely has a liner to hold the water in. The material of the liner is made of isn't the only thing to look out for. The slope the liner creates in the pond is also important depending on the types of plant life and animals you intend to keep in the pond.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pond linings are usually made from clay, concrete or pre-formed plastic.</li>
		<li>Plastic linings may create too steep a slope to the pond to maintain amphibians in your garden pond.</li>
		<li>Make sure the lining is intact and holds water, or that the pond is filled from a continuous source to be certain the pond won't drain once you stock it with fish.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><strong>3.	Add filtration to your garden pond.</strong></h3>	
	<p> While there are some kinds of fish you can keep in a garden pond without any form of filtration, your options can be significantly increased if you choose to add a mechanical or biological filter. Either filter system can be purchased in specialty stores or even large hardware stores.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Mechanical filters require more frequent cleaning, as they rely on sponges or other filters to capture particles as they flow through the water.</li>
		<li>Biological filters can simply be placed in the pond, but may require that you ensure the water quality remains within acceptable parameters for the bacteria in the filter.</li>
		<li>Goldfish and Koi fish can both be kept without a filtration system.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3><strong>4.	Add oxygenating plants.</strong></h3>
	<p>Keep your fish happy and healthy by maintaining a high oxygen level in the water of your garden pond. There are plants you can purchase that will naturally add oxygen to the water of your pond without any additional equipment.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Anacharis is considered the best plant for oxygenating purposes. It is commonly recommended that you add one bunch of anacharis for each square foot of your garden pond to keep the water oxygen levels optimal for fish.</li>
		<li>Water sprites also serve as capable oxygenators but are not quite as effective.</li>
	</ul>
