    <h2>Part 1: Preparing Your Pond.</h2>
	<p><strong>1. Check the dimensions of your pond.</strong></p>
	<p>In order to stock your garden pond with fish, you will need to make sure the pond is large enough to support the fish you intend to introduce. Fish need a certain amount of space, as well as variation in depth</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your pond should have a minimum 12-15 square feet of surface area in order to add fish.</li>
		<li>The pond will need one area that is greater than two feet deep for hibernating amphibians if you intend to have any frogs.</li>
		<li>The pond will also need a number of areas that are under one foot in depth to support different species of aquatic plant life.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>2.	Ensure the pond liner is appropiate and intact.</strong></p>
	<p>If your garden pond is manmade, it likely has a liner to hold the water in. The material of the liner is made of isn't the only thing to look out for. The slope the liner creates in the pond is also important depending on the types of plant life and animals you intend to keep in the pond.</p>
